# 🦆 MY_HUNTER - Duck&Hunt (in CSFML)

## 🎯 Project Description:

**My_Hunter** is a 2D mini-game inspired by *Duck Hunt*, developed in **C** using **CSFML** (the official C binding for SFML).  
The goal of the game is to click on an animated duck moving across the screen to score points.

## 🎮 Controls & Gameplay

### 🕹️ Controls:

- **Left mouse click**: shoot the duck  
- **Mouse movement**: aim  
- **ESC**: quit the game

### 🔄 Gameplay:

1. Ducks start flying across the screen.  
2. The player must click on them to "eliminate" them.  
3. The crosshair follows the mouse movement.  
4. The game can be exited at any time using the `ESC` key.

> 💡 **Personal note**:  
> This project is my **very first graphical game** made with CSFML.  
> It's a basic version: gameplay works, but **the project is not finished yet**.  
> I plan to add soon:
> - a **score system** displayed at the end,  
> - a **lose condition** (lives system),  
> - and a **simple start menu**.

## 🛠️ Installation & Compilation

### 📦 Requirements

Install CSFML on your system (Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt-get install libcsfml-dev
```  
▶️ Run the game:
```bash
make
./my_hunter
```
